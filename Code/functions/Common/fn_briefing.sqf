player createDiaryRecord ["Diary", ["Hints (with spoilers)", "A local resistance member has hidden a bag of pistols in the temporary prison just before your arrival.<br /><br />
The guards will be alarmed, if you gear up or escape. Prepare for a fight!<br /><br />
The start is difficult! Even experienced squads often fail the initial escape. Just restart and try again. I believe in you!<br /><br />
The prison is placed randomly. Search for the nearest settlement and have a look at the place-name sign.<br /><br />
Ambush enemy patrols to gear up and receive a map with the enemy POIs like ammodepots and comcenters.<br /><br />
Ambush an ammodepot to get heavy weapons like sniperrifles and launchers.<br /><br />
Ambush a comcenter and hack the com-terminal (box with green lamps). Stay near the box while hacking. An engineer hacks faster!<br /><br />
After making contact with HQ, two choppers and a gunship are dispatched to pick you up at a marked position on your map. You need to throw smoke or flare to signal the choppers you are ready for extraction.<br /><br />
Don't try to escape by boat or a captured chopper. The next island is to far away and the enemy AA is deadly for non-stealth choppers.<br /><br />
The mission is (intentionally) not easy. You probably won't make it to the choppers in the first try. Don't be upset. Try again. The mission will feel completly different every time and I garantuee you will have lots of fun even when you fail.<br /><br />
A lot of stuff is dynamic/random. Also there are plenty of customization parameters for different gameplay. You should definitly try this mission several times!<br /><br />"]];
