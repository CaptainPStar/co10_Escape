Escape 1.9

The mission (if you are playing as BLUFOR)
In this mission you and your squad was send out to scout the military CSAT and AAF presence on Altis in preparation for 
an NATO invasion. But your squad got captured by AAF and you are now held in an improvised prison awaiting CSAT officers 
to arrife for questioning. But NATO loyal insurgent managed to hide a backpack with weapons in the prison. Your task is 
now to overwhelm the guards, escape the prison, find a map of the island, make contact with NATO forces, reach the 
designated evacuation zone and escape Altis!

The mission is fully dynamic. Every playthrough will be different. Also the mission is quite hard to beat completly. 
You will most likely fail at the first try. But the mission is meant to be played more than once 
(infact our squad plays it serveral times the week).


About the mission

Escape was first devloped by Engima of Östgöta Ops for ArmA2. 
At that time me (NeoArmageddon) and Scruffy ported the mission to different islands and began customizing the mission.
When ArmA3 was released, Vormulac and HyperZ made the effort to port the mission over to ArmA3. From that point on Scruffy and me improved and fixed the mission to the current state.
Most of the scripts are replaced and were updated to A3 standards (but there is still some more room for improvements).
