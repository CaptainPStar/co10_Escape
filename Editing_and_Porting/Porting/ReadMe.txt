If you want to port co10_Escape to another terrain please read this slightly outdated post: https://forums.bohemia.net/forums/topic/180080-co10-escape/?do=findComment&comment=2838479

Please share your missions for placed markers here, to allow others to optimize and add to your work.
Some files here might be outdated or unfinished, not the markers currently exported and used.

For the actual mission with extraction points it is best to just unpack the latest build version.
